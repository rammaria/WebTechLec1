        <p>1. Tim Berners-Lee, director of W3C, developed the World Wide Web and launched it in <span id="ans">mid-1991</span>.</p>

        <p>2.<span id="ans">HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</span> is a coding system that is standardized for defining, presenting, and formatting the content of a web page. </p>

        <p>3.<span id="ans">Uniform Resource Locators or URL</span> is a unique address that identifies the location of a specific web resource on the Internet.</p>

        <p>4.<span id="ans">HTTP</span> is a communication protocol for applications used to retrieve hypermedia and hypertext resources available on the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>5. In 1991, HTML was first introduced by <span id="ans">Tim Berners-Lee</span> as an application of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).</p>

        <p>6. In 1995, HTML was published as IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) <span id="ans">RFC 1866</span> and HTML/2.0 became the standard for HTML</p>

        <p>7. HTTP/1.0 supports the following three methods: <span id="ans">GET</span>, <span id="ans">HEAD</span>, <span id="ans">POST</span></p>
        
        <p>8. HTTP/1.1 communicates using <span id="ans">persitent connection</span> which allows the connection between the client and server to continue until there is a close signal for the TCP connection.</p>
        
        <p>9. Additional methods for HTTP/1.1 are <span id="ans">DELETE</span>, <span id="ans">PUT</span>, <span id="ans">TRACE</span>, <span id="ans">CONNECT</span>.</p>
        
        <p>10. The <span id="ans">opening line</span> consists of the method, the path to the resource(s) needed, known as the the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the HTTP version used.</p>
        
        <p>11. <span id="ans">GET</span> is used to retrieve data and body from the URI specified.</p>
        
        <p>12. PUT is similar to <span id="ans">POST</span>, however, the entity given by the client is asked to be stored in the URI</p>
        
        <p>13. <span id="ans">HTTP Extensions</span> are used to define new request methods, headers and status codes to then be implemented for the servers and/or clients to use.</p>
        
        <p>14. The <span id="ans">TRACE</span> method requests a loop-back of request messages in the identified URI.</p>
        
        <p>15. The <span id="ans">OPTIONS</span> method requests information on the methods allowed in the specified URI</p>
        
        <p>16. <span id="ans">HTTP Response Message</span> is sent by the server to the HTTP client after a request.</p>
        
        <p>17. <span id="ans">HTTP/2</span> is an alternative to HTTP/1.1</p>
        
        <p>18. Content Negotiation, Multiplexing, Authentication/Authorization, Content/Transfer codings, Cache Control, Language and Character set, and Content Media Type are supported by <span id="ans">HTTP</span></p>
        
        <p>19. Uniform Resource Identifier or URI is a string of characters that determines a <span id="ans">resource</span></p>
        
        <p>20. <span id="ans">HTML 3.2</span> was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by W3C. It is also code named Wilbur</p>
        
        <p>Response Status Codes</p>
        <p>1** - <span id="ans">Informational</span><br>
        2** - <span id="ans">Successful</span><br>
        3** - <span id="ans">Redirection</span><br>
        4** - <span id="ans">Client Error</span><br>
        5** - <span id="ans">Server Error</span></p>
